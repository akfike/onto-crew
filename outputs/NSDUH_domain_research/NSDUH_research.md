The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is an annual survey that serves as the primary source of information on the prevalence, patterns, and consequences of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drug use and abuse, and mental disorders in the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population, aged 12 and older. 

The scope of the survey includes both the U.S. resident population and certain special groups such as homeless individuals, military personnel on active duty, and residents of institutional group quarters like jails and hospitals. The survey aims to provide estimates at the National, state, and substate levels.

The data collected by NSDUH includes information about the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco, initiation of substance use, frequency of substance use, substance dependence and abuse, perception of risk from substance use, substance use treatment, health topics, and mental health related information. 

The variables in the dataset represent a wide range of aspects, such as demographics (age, gender, race, education, employment, income, etc.), substance use history, detailed specific drug use information, mental health status, treatment history, and healthcare access and utilization. 

The data collected by NSDUH is used for various purposes. It is used to support prevention and treatment programs, monitor substance use trends, estimate the need for treatment and inform public health policy. Furthermore, the data is used by U.S. government health agencies, researchers, policy makers, and the public.

NSDUH data is also used to produce Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS) reports that provide information on the characteristics of admissions to substance abuse treatment and discharges from substance abuse treatment. 

Overall, the NSDUH dataset is a critical resource for understanding and addressing substance use and mental health issues in the United States.
