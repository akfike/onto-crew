The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is an annual survey conducted in the United States to collect data on substance use and mental health issues among the civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12 and older. The survey is sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and is considered a crucial source of information for understanding the prevalence and trends of substance use and mental health disorders in the country.

The scope of the NSDUH includes gathering data on the use of alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, and prescription drugs, as well as mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. The survey also collects information on related topics such as substance use disorders, treatment utilization, and perceived risks and attitudes towards substance use.

Data for the NSDUH is collected through in-person interviews conducted by trained interviewers using computer-assisted interviewing methods. The survey utilizes a stratified, multistage probability sampling design to ensure representation of various demographic groups in the population.

The data collected through the NSDUH is used for a variety of purposes, including monitoring trends in substance use and mental health, assessing the impact of interventions and policies, and informing public health programs and initiatives. Researchers, policymakers, and public health officials rely on NSDUH data to make informed decisions and recommendations regarding substance use prevention and treatment efforts.

The datasets from the NSDUH contain a wide range of variables that represent demographic information (such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and income), substance use patterns (frequency, quantity, and types of substances used), mental health indicators (symptoms, treatment history), and other related factors. Researchers can analyze these variables to examine associations, trends, and disparities in substance use and mental health outcomes across different population groups.

In conclusion, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health is a vital tool for understanding and addressing substance use and mental health issues in the United States. The comprehensive data collected through the survey serves as a valuable resource for informing public health policies, programs, and interventions aimed at promoting the well-being of the population.
