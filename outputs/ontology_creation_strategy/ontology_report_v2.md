An ontology, in the context of information science, is a formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to reason about the entities within that domain, and may be used to describe the domain. Ontology helps in knowledge sharing and reuse as it provides a common vocabulary and a common set of concepts, which facilitate the exchange of information among people and machines. It provides the foundation for data interoperability, enabling data from different sources to be integrated and used together. Furthermore, ontology is used in system modeling and design. Its use cases span across various disciplines, making it an integral part of modern information systems.

To develop an ontology, follow these steps:
1. Determine the Domain and Scope of the Ontology
2. Consider Reusing Existing Ontologies
3. Enumerate Important Terms in the Ontology
4. Define the Classes and the Class Hierarchy
5. Define the Properties of Classesâ€”Slots
6. Define the Facets of the Slots
7. Create Instances

The development of an ontology is an iterative process and it's crucial to have domain experts review and validate the ontology to ensure its accuracy and completeness. Also, take into account the scalability of the ontology, it should be designed to accommodate growth if the domain of the ontology is likely to expand in the future. 

Examples of well-formatted ontologies include Gene Ontology (GO), Friend of a Friend (FOAF), Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI), Dublin Core (DC), and Schema.org. These ontologies have a clear hierarchical structure, with categories branching into subcategories of increasing specificity. They use a controlled vocabulary and are designed to be easily understood, making them useful tools for structuring and understanding complex data.
