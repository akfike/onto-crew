An ontology is a formal representation of knowledge within a specific domain, typically organized in a hierarchical manner to capture relationships between concepts. Ontologies are commonly developed using ontology development tools such as Protégé, and they are supposed to convey a shared understanding of a domain, enabling knowledge sharing and integration across different systems. 

In terms of formatting, ontologies often consist of classes (concepts), properties (relationships between concepts), and instances (individual examples within a class). They are usually represented using ontology languages such as OWL (Web Ontology Language) or RDF (Resource Description Framework).

Examples of reputable ontologies include the Gene Ontology, which categorizes gene functions, and the FIBO (Financial Industry Business Ontology), which models financial concepts and relationships. These ontologies serve as good examples of well-structured and widely used ontologies in their respective domains. 

Overall, the development of ontologies involves careful consideration of domain-specific concepts, relationships, and constraints to ensure the ontology accurately represents the knowledge within that domain.
