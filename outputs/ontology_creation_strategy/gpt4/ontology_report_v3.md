An ontology is a structured representation of knowledge that includes descriptions of concepts, their properties, and their relationships. Ontologies are used in various fields, such as artificial intelligence, information science, semantic web, software engineering, and biomedical informatics, to facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse, data interoperability, and reasoning.

Common practices for developing ontologies involve several steps. Firstly, defining the scope of the ontology, identifying the important concepts and their relationships that are relevant to the domain of interest. Secondly, reusing existing ontologies as much as possible to save time and effort and to promote interoperability. Thirdly, representing the knowledge in a formal language, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL), that allows automated reasoning. Fourthly, documenting the ontology with natural language descriptions of the concepts, properties, and relationships. Lastly, validating the ontology by checking its logical consistency and its alignment with the real-world phenomena it is supposed to represent.

Ontologies are supposed to convey the meaning of the concepts and their relationships in a specific domain. They also provide a common vocabulary for stakeholders to communicate about the domain. Furthermore, if the ontology is represented in a formal language, it can be used by computers to infer new knowledge from the existing knowledge.

Ontologies are usually formatted as graphs, where the nodes represent concepts and the edges represent relationships between concepts. Alternatively, they can be formatted as tables or as hierarchical trees. The specific format depends on the ontology language and the tools used to create and view the ontology.

Good examples of well-structured ontologies include the Gene Ontology, which provides a structured vocabulary for the functions of genes and proteins in cells, and the Disease Ontology, which provides a structured vocabulary for human diseases and their relationships. Both of these ontologies are widely used in biomedical research and have contributed to many scientific discoveries.

For creating your own ontology, you could consider using ontology development tools such as Protégé, which provides a graphical user interface for creating, editing, and visualising ontologies in various formats, including OWL.
