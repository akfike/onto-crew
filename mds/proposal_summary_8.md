The domain of the proposed ontology in this research proposal revolves around the use of advanced technologies and methodologies to enhance data collection, integration, and utilization in the field of public health, with a particular focus on rural areas. The project aims to develop a user-friendly web-based database service that allows for efficient searching and improved user experience. To overcome the challenge of data sparsity in rural areas, the proposal suggests the use of transfer and generative learning techniques to synthesize data and enhance model performance. The scope of the project extends to the development of synthetic data that closely mimics the traits and patterns of actual rural data, ultimately increasing the overall dataset size and enabling more reliable model training and evaluation.
