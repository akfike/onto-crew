The proposed ontology aims to create a cross-domain knowledge graph to integrate health and justice for enhancing the resilience of rural communities. The domain of this proposed ontology broadly covers public health, environmental crises, social determinants of health, and justice within rural locales. However, the proposal does not specify which aspects within these domains are covered. The scope of the ontology is to construct an extensive, interdisciplinary knowledge graph that merges, portrays, and interconnects previously separate health and justice data sets. The goal is to aid researchers, practitioners, and educators in improving their understanding of risk environments in rural locations and strengthening their resilience. The project plans to make use of existing geo-enrichment services and initiatives, such as Esri's ArcGIS, Google Maps Platform, Bing Maps, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). These services and initiatives provide tools and platforms for enriching datasets with demographic, landscape, or geographic characteristics, potentially adding valuable context to the health and justice data sets. However, without a detailed breakdown, the specific aspects covered within the broad domains remain undefined.
