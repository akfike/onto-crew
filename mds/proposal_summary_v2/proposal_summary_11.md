The proposed ontology is situated in the healthcare domain with a focus on enhancing rural resilience within Alabama State. The project aims to leverage AI technology, facilitated through an AI Center to be established at the University of Alabama, to enhance data analysis and decision-making capabilities for the state's betterment. The ontology's domain involves data management, privacy, security, and ethics, while also incorporating aspects of capacity building, training, partnership cultivation, community engagement, project management, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the application of AI technology. 

The scope of the proposed ontology is broad, aiming to cover all these areas in the context of the state of Alabama, with the ultimate goal of enhancing data analysis and decision-making capabilities. The proposed ontology will align with various existing ontologies like SNOMED CT, LOINC, RadLex, BioPortal, AI-ML, Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO), Disease Ontology, and Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) in the healthcare and AI domains. This alignment will ensure that the ontology is reliable and interoperable with other systems, ultimately contributing to high-impact outcomes for Alabama's rural resilience.
