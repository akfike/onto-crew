The proposed ontology is part of a comprehensive project situated in the healthcare domain, aiming to enhance rural resilience in Alabama State. The project's domain involves data management, privacy, security, and ethics, alongside capacity building, training, partnership cultivation, community engagement, project management, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the application of AI technology. The project's deliverables are divided into alpha-level and beta-level, with the former providing a preliminary version and roadmap, and the latter offering a more refined version of the project, incorporating user feedback and more sophisticated features. The project timeline consists of three key phases: Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), the development of the Knowledge Graph (KG), and the creation and deployment of deliverables. Potential challenges include the establishment of protocols for the Institutional Review Board (IRB), data access, governance, security, and the recruitment of local community participants. The project is managed by a diverse team of specialists, led by Gong, the Collaboration Lead, and Dr. Chen Wang, the Integration Lead. The ontology's broad scope aims to cover all these areas in the context of Alabama, with the ultimate goal of enhancing data analysis and decision-making capabilities. The proposed ontology will align with various existing ontologies in the healthcare and AI domains, ensuring its reliability and interoperability with other systems.
