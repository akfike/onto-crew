The proposed ontology is centered at the intersection of rural resilience, healthcare, and digital disparities. Rural resilience encapsulates the capacity of rural communities to absorb, recover from, and prepare for future shocks or stresses, ranging from natural disasters to societal or economic challenges. Healthcare, in this context, pertains to the healthcare infrastructure and services available in rural settings, covering aspects of healthcare delivery, accessibility, affordability, and quality. Digital disparities represent the uneven distribution and utilization of digital technologies, which can either exacerbate or alleviate health inequities in rural locales.

The ontology's aim is to capture the intricate interplay of these domains, with a particular focus on the role of digital technologies in rural healthcare. This includes understanding how access to and utilization of these technologies can either cause health disparities or resolve them. The ontology's scope is broad and aims to encapsulate all key variables within these domains and their interconnections, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and analyzing the complexities of rural healthcare, digital disparities, and resilience strategies. This includes factors such as geographic location, socioeconomic status, education level, technology infrastructure and access, health outcomes, and policy implications.

In essence, the proposed ontology seeks to provide a holistic view of the intersection of rural resilience, healthcare, and digital disparities, with a focus on the role of digital technologies. It offers a robust theoretical framework that can guide research, policy, and practice in this area.
