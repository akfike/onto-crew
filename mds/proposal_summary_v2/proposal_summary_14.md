The domain of the proposed ontology is centered around Healthcare, with a special emphasis on rural resilience. It intersects with several other domains such as Data Management, Privacy, Security, Ethics, Capacity Building, Training, Partnership Cultivation, Community Engagement, Project Management, Interdisciplinary Collaboration, and the application of AI Technology. However, the main focus remains improving healthcare services in rural areas of Alabama State.

The scope of the proposed ontology is wide-ranging, covering several aspects of the healthcare domain, specifically targeting rural resilience enhancement in Alabama State. These aspects include data management, privacy, security, ethics, capacity building, training, partnership cultivation, community engagement, project management, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the application of AI technology.

The proposed ontology will align with existing ones in the healthcare and AI domains in several ways. In terms of data management, privacy, and security, it will align with healthcare ontologies such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, and the HIPAA ontology. For ethics, it will align with the American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics (AMA-CME) ontology and the AI Ethics Guidelines ontology. It will align with ontologies such as the Competency and Learning Outcome Ontology (CaLO) in healthcare and AI domains for capacity building and training, and the Social Participation Ontology (SPO) and the Interorganizational Relationship Ontology (IRO) for partnership cultivation and community engagement. The ontology will link with the Collaboration Ontology (CO) for interdisciplinary collaboration and the AI Task Ontology (AITO) and the AI Problem-Solving Method Ontology (AIPS MO) for the application of AI technology.

The proposed ontology will enhance data analysis and decision-making capabilities, thereby significantly contributing to rural resilience in Alabama State. It will provide a framework for improved data management, enhanced security, and privacy, facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, and allow for the application of AI technology. Furthermore, it will facilitate community engagement and capacity building by providing a structured framework for training and partnership cultivation, thereby enhancing the resilience of rural communities in Alabama State.
