The proposed ontology is positioned within the domain of healthcare and is designed to address several challenges in rural and underrepresented areas, particularly in the Alabama Black Belt region in the United States. The ontology aims to enhance the development and effectiveness of knowledge graphs in these regions by employing transfer learning and generative techniques. These methodologies are expected to mitigate the impact of data sparsity in these areas, a significant barrier to the development and deployment of effective healthcare technologies.

Furthermore, the ontology acknowledges the unique cultural and social contexts of the target areas, which have been largely overlooked in previous technological developments. It aims to address this gap by improving the interaction between end users and the knowledge graph database, using natural languages. This would be achieved by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) process to collect valuable input from the community. The data gathered will be preprocessed to ensure compatibility with LLMs, and the model will be fine-tuned with this curated data.

The ultimate goal of the proposed ontology is to develop a user-friendly interface that accommodates the diverse linguistic and sociocultural contexts of the target users. This would empower end users to interact with and query the knowledge graph database using their own natural languages, even in the presence of cultural and social constraints.

In terms of the scope, the ontology extends to various stakeholders, including health workers, social workers, religious leaders, and social network influencers. The project has effectively engaged a diverse range of stakeholders spanning government, industry, academia, non-profits, and citizen service groups, demonstrating a holistic and inclusive approach to its implementation. This comprehensive network, along with the advanced technologies and methodologies employed, underscores the vast scope of the proposed ontology project. It is worth noting that such a project comes with its own challenges, including the complexity of queries, the need for substantial computational power and data storage capacity, and potential ethical implications like data privacy and algorithmic bias, which should be taken into account during the implementation of the ontology.
