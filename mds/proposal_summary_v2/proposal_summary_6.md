The proposed ontology's domain primarily focuses on health data on equity and mental health disparities, justice-related datasets, and datasets related to environmental issues. These are collected from various public datasets and are relevant to the factors outlined in the proposal. The health data will include crucial insurance information and will focus on addressing substantial public health issues. Justice-related datasets will explore the intricate interplay between social and criminal justice, health equity, and mental health disparities. The datasets related to environmental issues will scrutinize the effects of environmental crises on health equity, as well as social and criminal justice. 

The ontology's scope extends to facilitating data consolidation and integration within the framework of public health and environmental crises in rural communities. The ontology encompasses a sophisticated array of knowledge encompassing diverse subjects, clusters of concerns, and their interconnections. To ensure the validity of the ontology, OWL and SHACL are employed to define the semantics of the data and validate it against specific shapes or constraints. Depending on the available data and project needs, the scope of the ontology could potentially expand to cover other related areas such as rural development or agriculture.
