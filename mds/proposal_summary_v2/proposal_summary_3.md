The domain of the proposed ontology covers four main areas: public health, environmental crises, social determinants of health, and justice, all within the context of rural communities. The ontology aims to provide a holistic view of these areas by integrating them into a comprehensive knowledge graph. The ontology's scope is distinguished by its cross-domain focus and its utilization of geo-enrichment services like Esri's ArcGIS, Google Maps Platform, Bing Maps, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) to add further context to the datasets it uses.

The integration of these domains into the proposed ontology can be achieved through a series of steps: identifying the key concepts, relationships, and attributes within each domain; representing these in a structured way using ontology languages; mapping equivalent or similar concepts across the different domains; and using geo-enrichment services to add valuable spatial context to the ontology.

Existing ontologies in the fields of public health, environmental crises, social determinants of health, and justice can significantly contribute to the proposed ontology. They can provide foundational concepts, help model how different factors influence health and justice outcomes in rural communities, and establish relationships between different domains. Integrating these ontologies with geo-enrichment services will enhance the granularity of the data in the ontology, enabling more accurate and localized predictions and interventions.

In conclusion, the proposed ontology aims to build a comprehensive, cross-domain knowledge graph that effectively models the complex interactions between health and justice in rural communities.
