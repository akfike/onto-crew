The proposed ontology aims to create a cross-domain knowledge graph to integrate health and justice for enhancing the resilience of rural communities. The domain of this proposed ontology covers public health, environmental crises, social determinants of health, and justice within rural locales. It is unique in its aim to integrate all these domains, providing a holistic view of rural health and justice. Additionally, it plans to leverage existing geo-enrichment services like Esri's ArcGIS, Google Maps Platform, Bing Maps, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) to add geographic, demographic, and landscape context to the health and justice datasets.

The ontology differs from existing ones in the field due to its cross-domain focus and integration with geo-enrichment services. While there are individual ontologies for public health, justice, environmental crises, and social determinants of health, this proposed ontology aims to integrate these into a comprehensive knowledge graph, providing a more comprehensive and contextual view compared to the existing ontologies in these fields.

However, its development presents challenges, including the complexity of the subject matter, integrating diverse domains into a single ontology, leveraging existing geo-enrichment services, and potential data privacy issues. The ontology's development will undoubtedly be a complex and challenging task, but with careful planning and execution, it is possible to create a robust and effective ontology that achieves its goals.
