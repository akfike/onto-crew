The domain of the proposed ontology is health and healthcare, specifically focusing on vaccine hesitancy and resource allocation in under-served communities. It involves entity mapping, data quality assessment, automated tests, and a review from an interdisciplinary perspective. The ontology aims to adhere to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework in its query design and will be made openly accessible. A key component of the ontology is the user interface for a knowledge graph database that incorporates various geographic scales and data domains. 

The scope of the ontology extends to optimizing the allocation of mobile healthcare units to under-served communities by leveraging the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph will provide individual-level information on vaccine hesitancy in targeted regions, facilitating strategic and effective resource allocation. The project also involves designing a user-friendly interface for the knowledge graph database to ensure easy access and interaction for users, including decision-makers in healthcare, healthcare professionals, data analysts, and the communities being served by the mobile healthcare units. The ultimate goal is to facilitate strategic and effective resource allocation, ensuring that mobile healthcare units are deployed where they are most needed, and that resources are distributed in a way that most effectively addresses vaccine hesitancy in under-served communities.
