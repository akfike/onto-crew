The proposed ontology is situated in the domain of healthcare with a focus on rural resilience within Alabama State. The project, led by Principal Investigators Gong, Lee, and Geyer, aims to leverage AI technology to enhance data analysis and decision-making capabilities for Alabama's betterment. To achieve this, an AI Center will be established at the University of Alabama, serving as a hub of innovation for research and development in AI. The center will encourage participation from diverse stakeholders, including government agencies, industry representatives, academia, nonprofits, and citizen groups, contributing to the real-world use cases targeted by the project. 

In terms of project management, a kick-off meeting will introduce the project's objectives and timeline to all stakeholders. Regular weekly meetings will provide a platform for sharing progress updates, collaboratively tackling challenges, brainstorming solutions, and making necessary adjustments to the project plan. Various feedback mechanisms will be introduced to promote continuous communication and an inclusive, participatory environment.

Regarding data handling, the project will collaborate closely with data providers such as federal agencies, data repositories, and regional agencies. The data science workflow will include activities like data inventory, data curation, schema mapping, entity resolution, data integration and quality assessment, and data reconciliation. Non-profit organizations and citizen groups will provide access to ground-truth data and offer an understanding of the local social and cultural context, helping to evaluate the practical applicability of the knowledge graph in real-world scenarios.

Lastly, a data governance board with diverse stakeholder representatives will oversee the project. The board will ensure that the project's objectives are being met effectively and efficiently. Thus, the proposed ontology exhibits a comprehensive and inclusive approach, engaging a wide range of stakeholders, and employing advanced AI technology to enhance rural resilience within Alabama State.
