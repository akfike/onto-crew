The domain of the proposed ontology encompasses three key areas: health, justice, and data management. Within the health domain, there is a particular focus on public health issues, as evidenced by the numerous references to research papers and studies on racial disparities in health outcomes and the impact of COVID-19 on different communities. In the justice domain, the proposed ontology addresses discrimination and equity, with references drawing from legal texts, human rights reports, and academic papers exploring these issues in various contexts. The data management domain is supported by references to technical reports, standards, and guidelines for managing and using data in the fields of health and justice. These sources provide valuable guidance on best practices and standards, which can be incorporated into the proposed ontology.

In terms of scope, the proposed ontology is aimed at both conducting research and developing applications in the areas of health and justice. References to case studies and practical applications of data management in these fields suggest the potential for the proposed ontology to be utilized in similar contexts. Thus, the scope spans from the theoretical understanding of complex interrelationships between health, justice, and data management, to the practical application of this knowledge for policy-making, intervention design, data management, and technological solution development. Overall, the proposed ontology aims to facilitate a data-driven approach to tackling intricate societal challenges, leveraging a broad spectrum of resources and insights from the referenced works.
