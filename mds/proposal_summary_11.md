The research proposal at hand is centered around the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance Rural Resilience in Alabama. The key areas of focus include data management, privacy, security, and ethics, with the University's Institutional Review Board overseeing compliance. The project also aims to foster training and capacity building within the Alabama State context, with the creation of accessible training resources such as manuals, guides, and tutorials. The plan is to enhance the capabilities of entities like the ADPH, NASW, and NAMI, aiding them to improve their data infrastructure and create their own training programs.

The project team understands the immense value of collaboration, particularly when working with large-scale knowledge graph systems. Therefore, they express their eagerness to collaborate with existing initiatives that have demonstrated significant strides in related areas. This includes initiatives supported by the NIH, NIJ, NOAA, USGS, and the Department of Transportation, among others.

The proposal also outlines the plan to facilitate interdisciplinary meetings to tackle project challenges, brainstorm solutions, and identify potential avenues for collaboration. They plan to contribute to the development and usage of collaborative tools and platforms, including cloud-based platforms for efficient data storage, sharing, and querying, as well as project management tools and collaborative software. The project also plans to co-author policy briefs and spearhead public engagement activities such as community forums, public lectures, and educational events. 

All these activities are geared towards increasing the project's visibility, stimulating public awareness and support, and providing channels for community participation and engagement. This comprehensive approach ensures that the project not only adheres to the necessary legal and ethical frameworks but that the knowledge gained is practically applicable in real-world scenarios.
