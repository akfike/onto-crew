The domain of the proposed ontology is the cross-section of public health, environmental science, and data science. This project is aimed at enhancing rural resilience to crises, particularly public health and environmental crises, by leveraging the power of data. The scope of this research is to construct a comprehensive interdisciplinary knowledge graph that integrates multiple, previously separate, health and justice data sets. This graph is expected to improve the understanding of risk environments in rural locations, therefore strengthening their resilience. The project is also set to advance knowledge in computer and information science, and social and behavioral science. It aims to empower underrepresented groups in rural communities and is set to generate a wide array of resources for the interdisciplinary educational research community. The team is committed to working in sync with existing initiatives like the NSF-funded KnowWhereGraph and other Proto-OKN themes.
