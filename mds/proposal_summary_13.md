The domain of this research project is the development of a comprehensive Knowledge Graph (KG) system purposed to enhance rural resilience. The KG will be developed with a specific focus on the state of Alabama and will incorporate aspects of evidence-centered design, transfer and generative learning, with emphasis on the developmental process of the KG. Furthermore, the project will also focus on user-centered design of the conceptual framework and social and cultural analysis within the Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) process. 

The scope of the project encompasses the creation of training materials, data access and curation, and the design and refinement of user interfaces. It will also include gathering feedback from end-users to further enhance the KG development and user interface. The project will also handle tasks related to data access, curation, and KG development in specific domains such as health, justice, and geoinformatics. 

The project's deliverables will encompass the alpha, beta, and final deployment stages. The project's progress will be evaluated through quarterly examinations conducted by an autonomous data governance board through scrutiny of data, documentation, and project-generated artifacts. The board will also conduct interviews with the Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-Principal Investigators (Co-PIs) to provide feedback and recommendations based on their proficiency in data governance research.
