The domain and scope of the proposed ontology within this research project are expansive. The project focuses on socio-economic research that is community-based, with a particular emphasis on health and justice scenarios in underrepresented communities within the United States. The application of the S2 grid system and various open standards as part of the methodology signifies an innovative approach to data collection and analysis. The research process actively engages communities, gathering their insights and perspectives to shape the research direction. This is achieved through a combination of established socio-economic research methods and machine learning techniques, providing a comprehensive, multi-dimensional approach to understanding community dynamics. The strategy strikes a balance between being responsive to community changes and sustaining outreach efforts, indicating a long-term commitment to the research process and its outcomes. The research project also includes strategic measures to prevent the risk of developing a closed, proprietary system and emphasizes enhancing transparency throughout the life cycle of the project development process. The project will use standardized data formats, implement a data governance plan, and maintain a detailed record of data lineage. Furthermore, open-source software will be created in the knowledge graph development phase, with APIs provided for seamless data integration from external systems. The research project's scope and domain are thus characterized by community engagement, transparency, and a balance between responsiveness and sustainability.
