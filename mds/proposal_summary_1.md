The scope of this research proposal is to create a comprehensive, cross-domain knowledge graph that amalgamates multiple, previously separated, health and justice datasets. This integrated knowledge graph is expected to provide valuable insights into risk environments in rural areas, thus aiding in strengthening their resilience against crises. In addition to this, the project also aims to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the fields of computer science, information science, social science, and behavioral science. Furthermore, the project is committed to empowering underrepresented groups in rural communities and is set to yield a wealth of resources for the interdisciplinary educational research community. The research team intends to align its efforts with existing initiatives such as the NSF-funded KnowWhereGraph and other Proto-OKN themes.
