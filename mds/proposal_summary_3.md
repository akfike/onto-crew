The domain and scope of the proposed research cover community-based socio-economic research with a focus on health and justice circumstances in communities within the United States, particularly those not yet reached by community-based efforts. The research will employ the S2 grid system and several open standards in its methodologies. It will actively engage with the communities involved, gathering insights and viewpoints to inform the research. The research process will employ a mix of recognized socio-economic research methods as well as machine learning techniques, with a strategy that balances responsiveness to community changes and sustainability of outreach efforts.
