The domain and scope of the proposed ontology in this research project revolve around public health disparities, specifically vaccine hesitancy and substance abuse in marginalized and underserved communities. The domain focuses on the use of a knowledge graph, adhering to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, to understand these disparities. The scope extends to designing queries tailored to individual, interpersonal, and community levels of influence, identifying areas with prevalent vaccine hesitancy, and using this information to optimize resource allocation. The knowledge graph will also provide insights on critical aspects related to substance abuse to develop targeted interventions and support systems, with a particular focus on the Alabama Black Belt region.
