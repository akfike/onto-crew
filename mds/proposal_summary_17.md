The domain of the proposed research project revolves around the establishment of a Knowledge Graph (KG) system, specifically targeted at enhancing rural resilience. This endeavor is chiefly aimed at addressing the apparent digital divide that tends to affect rural communities due to limited access to affordable broadband internet. This digital divide has profound implications on various facets of life in these rural communities, one of the most significant being their capacity to access and effectively utilize healthcare services.

The research project seeks to confront these challenges head-on through the implementation of community-based participatory activities. These activities are intended to streamline better resource allocation, facilitate informed policy development, and foster partnerships within these communities. 

The scope of this project is quite expansive, involving an array of stakeholders that include interdisciplinary researchers, educators, students, school administrators, and industry partners from a variety of practice domains. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide these stakeholders with a comprehensive and easily accessible knowledge graph. The successful execution of this endeavor is expected to significantly advance teaching and learning in the domain of knowledge graphs. 

In a nutshell, this research project is a multi-stakeholder, community-oriented initiative aimed at leveraging the power of Knowledge Graphs to bridge the digital divide in rural communities and enhance their resilience, particularly in the realm of healthcare services.
