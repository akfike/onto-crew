The domain of the proposed ontology is the design, development, and implementation of a Knowledge Graph (KG) system with the specific purpose of promoting rural resilience. The project confronts the significant issue of the Digital Divide, especially prevalent in rural areas characterized by lower socioeconomic status where affordable broadband internet access is lacking. The method utilized to address this challenge is through community-based participatory research activities. The broader impact of the proposed project is the creation of a comprehensive, accessible knowledge graph that enables effective resource allocation, policy development, and partnership establishment within rural communities. The scope of the project extends to a diverse group of stakeholders, including interdisciplinary researchers, educators, students, school administrators, and industry partners across various practice domains, providing them with a rich resource for the further advancement of teaching and learning in knowledge graphs.
