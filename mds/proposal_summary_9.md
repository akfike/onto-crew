The domain and scope of the proposed ontology in this research proposal center on the application of large language models and knowledge graphs in the field of public health, specifically in rural, underrepresented areas. The proposed project aims to address data sparsity and enhance knowledge graph development in rural areas like the Alabama Black Belt region by leveraging transfer and generative learning techniques. The project incorporates a community-based participatory research process to collect and preprocess data from the community for compatibility with large language models. The ultimate objective is to develop an interactive, culturally sensitive query interface for the knowledge graph database. The scope includes engaging a range of stakeholders such as government institutions, academic bodies, non-profits, and community service groups for a holistic approach.
