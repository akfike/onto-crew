The domain of the proposed ontology is the development and implementation of a knowledge graph system aimed at enhancing the resilience of rural communities. This project is a pioneering initiative that stems from the currently under-construction AI research and education center at the University of Alabama. The primary goal of this center is to devise bespoke AI solutions specifically designed to cater to the needs of communities with low socio-economic status, a common occurrence in Alabama. The project aims to uplift their living conditions by equipping them with AI technology.

The scope of the project extends to managing an escalating volume of data and user interactions across all the Southern U.S states. The project's sustainability will be linked to the AI center under development, sharing staff resources and operational roles. This collaboration ensures the long-term maintenance of the knowledge graph system, its cost-efficiency, and the provision of adequate staffing to keep the system running optimally.

Moreover, the project aims to promote rural resilience to public health and environmental crises, such as vaccine hesitancy, the opioid crisis, drought, and floods. This focus is supported by various funding agencies, including NOAA, USGS, and NIH. The National Water Center resides on the University of Alabama campus, and the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH) is dedicated to improving water prediction and enhancing community resilience to water-related challenges.

In terms of data/AI ethics standards and guidance, the team will follow the principles from Executive Order 13960 for developing trustworthy AI. This commitment involves implementing CBPR, transfer learning, and fine-tuning LLMs. Roundtable discussions will be held under the guidance of the University administration and ethical workforce to uphold national values and legality. The project also aims to prioritize transparency in the development process and ensure alignment with ethical principles.
