The domain and scope of the proposed ontology within this research project are expansive. It concentrates on enhancing rural resilience to public health and environmental crises. The domain encompasses the development of robust systems for crisis management, with a focus on mental health emergencies, substance abuse issues, disease pandemics, epidemics, vaccine uptake challenges, climate change, drought conditions, and flood events. The research involves collaboration with various stakeholders such as the National Association of Social Workers, the Department of Public Health, Emergency Medical Services, the Opioid Overdose and Addiction Council, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The scope of the project includes identifying and consolidating the capabilities required for each use case, categorizing them into two main groups: resources, and community engagement and education. It also focuses on addressing the challenges faced by rural communities with data collection, including cost-related factors, data silos, and lack of efficient data governance plans.
