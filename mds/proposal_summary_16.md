The domain of the proposed research project is the promotion of rural resilience through the creation of a Knowledge Graph (KG) system. The project seeks to address the digital divide prevalent in rural communities, which often have limited access to affordable broadband internet. This digital divide affects various aspects of life in these communities, including their ability to access and utilize healthcare services effectively. The research project intends to confront these challenges through community-based participatory activities, thus facilitating better resource allocation, policy development, and partnerships within these communities. The scope of the project is broad, involving a diverse group of stakeholders ranging from interdisciplinary researchers, educators, students, and school administrators to industry partners across various practice domains. The ultimate aim of the project is to provide these stakeholders with a comprehensive and accessible knowledge graph that can further advance teaching and learning in the domain of knowledge graphs.
