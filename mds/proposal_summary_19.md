The domain and scope of the proposed ontology in this research proposal is centered around the development of a Knowledge Graph (KG) system that aims to increase rural resilience. This is achieved by addressing the digital divide in rural communities, which significantly impacts their access to and use of healthcare services. The research proposal outlines the utilization of community-based participatory activities to enhance resource distribution, contribute to policy development, and foster partnerships within these communities. The scope of the project is broad, encompassing various stakeholders including researchers, educators, students, school administrators, and industry partners.

The ultimate goal of this project is to equip these stakeholders with a comprehensive and accessible knowledge graph, which is expected to accelerate teaching and learning in the field of knowledge graphs. Overall, the ontology of this research proposal is built around a community-focused initiative that leverages Knowledge Graphs to bridge the digital divide in rural communities and enhance their resilience, specifically in relation to healthcare services. This is reflected in the wide range of studies cited in the proposal, covering topics from public health and environmental health to mental health and the justice system, all of which are vital components of rural resilience.
