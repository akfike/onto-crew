The primary domain of this proposal encompasses the utilization of novel artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (references 58, 59, 60, 61, 62) in several contexts, including healthcare (references 56, 57), crime rates during the pandemic (reference 53), and the impacts of racial meanings and structural racism on the war on drugs (reference 52). Moreover, the proposal extends to the application of ontology design patterns to define SHACL shapes (reference 54) and the validation of geospatial linked data (reference 55).

The scope of the research project is vast, as it focuses on the application of these advanced techniques in a variety of settings. It includes the assessment of COVID-19's impact on crime rates and the use of mobile vaccination units to expand COVID-19 vaccine access to underserved populations. Furthermore, the project proposes to use generative adversarial networks for predicting the epidemic trends of COVID-19, estimating human mobility responses to the pandemic, and oversampling tabular data for imbalanced learning. 

Overall, the proposed ontology in this research proposal spans across the fields of healthcare, criminology, sociology, and data science, with the ultimate aim to provide insights and solutions for various pressing societal issues.
