The domain and scope of the proposed ontology in this research project are focused on consolidating and integrating various public datasets to build a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to resilience against public health and environmental crises. The domain includes key pillars such as robust healthcare infrastructure, public health education, environmental management strategies, emergency preparedness, participatory decision-making, and a commitment to health equity and access to justice. The scope extends to the exploration of health equity, mental health disparities, social and criminal justice, and environmental crises. The datasets will be represented and validated using OWL and SHACL. The project gives particular attention to the Alabama Black Belt communities, aiming to address major public health issues and the disproportionate impact of environmental crises on underrepresented communities. The ultimate goal is to use this integrated knowledge to improve the resilience of these communities in anticipation, management, response, and recovery from various health and environmental disruptions.
