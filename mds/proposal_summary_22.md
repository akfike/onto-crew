The domain of the proposed ontology in this research proposal is centred on the application and integration of large language models and knowledge graphs. It has specific applications in generating SQL-query exercises, pre-training models for question answering, and exploring the societal and ethical implications of these technologies. The pivotal areas of interest include digital ethics, societal adaptation to language models, and the digital divide, particularly as it relates to STEM representation and health access.

The scope of the proposed research is comprehensive and multifaceted. It grapples with socio-technical issues such as underrepresentation in STEM careers, digital health access inequities during the pandemic, and the persistence of the urban/rural digital divide among older adults, with a specific focus on racial and ethnic disparities. The project aims to provide insights into these critical areas by leveraging the capabilities of large language models and knowledge graphs, ultimately contributing to a more equitable digital society.
