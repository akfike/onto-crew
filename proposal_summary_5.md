The proposed ontology focuses on enhancing rural resilience in relation to public health and environmental crises. Its domain includes concepts and relationships concerning public health, environmental crises, rural communities, and resilience strategies. In particular, it covers resources (both tangible and intangible) and community engagement and education, implying a comprehensive approach to rural resilience.

The scope of the ontology extends to facilitating communication and data exchange between stakeholders, necessitating the inclusion of related concepts, and mechanisms for data collection, storage, retrieval, and sharing that take into account data privacy, security, access, and control.

The ontology's domain and scope are also shaped by key collaborations with entities such as the National Association of Social Workers, the Department of Public Health, Emergency Medical Services, the Opioid Overdose and Addiction Council, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. These entities contribute unique perspectives and expertise related to rural resilience, enriching the ontology's comprehensiveness and effectiveness. For instance, the National Association of Social Workers provides a human-centric perspective, the Department of Public Health brings a health-centric angle, and the Emergency Medical Services offer insights into emergency management aspects of rural resilience.

In essence, the proposed ontology is designed to capture the complexity and multi-faceted nature of rural resilience, focusing on public health and environmental crises while considering the unique challenges and resources of rural communities and the contributions of various stakeholders.
