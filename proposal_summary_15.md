The domain of the proposed ontology is centered around Healthcare, specifically in areas such as telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, electronic health records, and healthcare information systems, with a special emphasis on enhancing rural resilience in areas affected by the digital divide. The project employs a Knowledge Graph (KG) approach to develop solutions to this issue, with a focus on ethical considerations and developing standards and guidelines. The AI technology being applied is the Knowledge Graph approach to understand the complex relationship between broadband access, healthcare delivery, and rural resilience.

The scope of the proposed ontology is wide-ranging, covering several aspects of the healthcare domain, specifically targeting rural resilience enhancement in Alabama State. These aspects include data management, privacy, security, ethics, capacity building, training, partnership cultivation, community engagement, project management, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the application of AI technology.

The proposed ontology will align with existing ones in the healthcare and AI domains in several ways. The identified ontologies include SNOMED CT, LOINC, HL7 FHIR, BioPortal, RADLEX, and OMRSE, each covering different aspects of healthcare and AI technology that are relevant to our project, such as telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, electronic health records, healthcare information systems, and Knowledge Graph approach.

The incorporation of these ontologies into the project will involve mapping the terms and concepts in our data to the terms and concepts in these ontologies. This may require the development of a custom ontology that integrates these existing ontologies, or the use of ontology alignment techniques to map between them. The chosen approach will depend on the specific requirements of our project and the characteristics of our data. After the ontologies have been incorporated, there will be a need to continually update and maintain them to ensure they remain accurate and up-to-date.

The proposed ontology will enhance data analysis and decision-making capabilities, thereby significantly contributing to rural resilience in Alabama State. It will provide a framework for improved data management, enhanced security, and privacy, facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, and allow for the application of AI technology. Furthermore, it will facilitate community engagement and capacity building by providing a structured framework for training and partnership cultivation, thereby enhancing the resilience of rural communities in Alabama State.
