The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is an annual survey conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) that provides national-level data on alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug use, and mental health issues among individuals aged 12 and older in the U.S. The survey collects data through in-person interviews and covers topics such as substance use, substance use disorders, mental health disorders, treatment utilization, and related factors. The data collected is used for monitoring trends, assessing policy impact, identifying at-risk populations, and informing public health initiatives. The datasets from NSDUH include variables such as demographic characteristics, substance use behaviors, mental health indicators, treatment history, and more, providing valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and healthcare professionals to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.
